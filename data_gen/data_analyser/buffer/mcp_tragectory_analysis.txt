Ender pearls have no use, but can stack up to 64. Java Edition 1.0.0 Beta 1.9 Prerelease Ender pearls are now less commonly found near bodies of water since endermen now teleport away when in contact with water. Before this version, endermen didn\'t attempt to teleport and were damaged /killed from water much more frequently, causing numerous ender pearls to occur around bodies of water. Later, on a suggestion from Reddit user isJesus, Notch implemented the teleporting feature for ender pearls. &#91; 1 &#93; &#91; 2 &#93; &#91; 3 &#93; Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 Added teleporting feature to ender pearls. Using an ender pearl to teleport resulted in being kicked from servers for hacking. This is due to a check triggering that was supposed to prevent modified clients from moving too quickly. Ender pearls now stack up to 16. Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 Ender pearls are now used to craft eyes of ender . Ender pearls can now be found in the new stronghold altar chests . 1.3.1 12w24a The texture of ender pearls has been changed. 1.8 14w02a As part of the revamp of the trading system, cleric villagers now buy ender pearls. 14w03a Villager clerics no longer buy ender pearls. 14w11b Ender pearls have a 5% chance to spawn endermites when used. 14w32a Thrown ender pearls now vanish when their owner dies. 1.9 15w31a Ender pearls can now be thrown in Creative mode. 15w34c Ender pearls now have a cooldown after using them. 15w41a Villager clerics now sell ender pearls for 4 7 emeralds , as one of their tier III trades. 15w49a Thrown ender pearls now take the user\'s motion into account.

Equipment model definitions are loaded from assets/&lt;namespace&gt;/models/equipment/&lt;path&gt;.json . These can then be referenced by the equippable component with a model id of namespace:path . The model definition is an object with fields: wolfbody , horsebody , llamabody , humanoid , humanoidleggings , wings All fields are optional, and can be used to specify a list of layers for the given model layer type.

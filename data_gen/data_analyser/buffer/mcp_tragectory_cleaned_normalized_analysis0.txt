For this type of custom game, you\'ll need to approach this differently. Since your card game uses actual OSRS items to represent poker cards, let me help you with practical steps: Part 1: Determining NPC Items (Cards) For a custom card game, the items used as "cards" won\'t be found in the official game data as "playing cards". Instead, you\'ll need to work with the game master or community that created this. Here\'s how you\'ll typically determine what\'s in an NPC\'s deck: Manual Inspection: Right-click NPCs → examine to see what items they\'re carrying Game Rules: The custom game host will have a defined mapping of OSRS items to poker card values (e.g., "Rune essence = Ace of spades") Community Documentation: Check Discord servers, clan chats, or forums where this game is hosted for the item-card mapping Part 2: Calculate Your Poker Chances Once you know what items represent which poker cards, I can help calculate your win probability! You\'ll need to provide: Your two hole cards (as poker hand notation) Any community cards (flop, turn, river) Optionally, known opponent cards if they\'re revealed during bidding For example, if Rune swords represent Kings and Dragon daggers represent Queens, and you have: Your cards: King of Spades (rune sword), King of Hearts (rune sword) Community cards: Queen of Clubs (dragon dagger), 10 of Diamonds(sapphire), 7 of Hearts(ruby) You\'d provide this as: As Kh and Jd 10c 7h when ready to calculate. Would you like to provide a sample hand (your cards and any community cards) so I can demonstrate the poker win calculator? Make sure to specify which items represent which poker card values in your custom system first.', 'type': 'passage'}

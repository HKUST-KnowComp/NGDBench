Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally. role: function content: 논문 상세 정보 No LLM Solved Yu Tsumura's 554th Problem 저자: Simon Frieder, William Hart 출판일: 2025-08-05 카테고리: cs.LG DOI: None 링크: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03685 PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03685.pdf 초록: We show, contrary to the optimism about LLM's problem-solving abilities, fueled by the recent gold medals that were attained, that a problem exists -- Yu Tsumura's 554th problem -- that a) is within the scope of an IMO problem in terms of proof sophistication, b) is not a combinatorics problem which has caused issues for LLMs, c) requires fewer proof techniques than typical hard IMO problems, d) has a publicly available solution (likely in the training data of LLMs), and e) that cannot be readily solved by any existing off-the-shelf LLM (commercial or open-source). role: function content: 논문 상세 정보 Self-Questioning Language Models 저자: Lili Chen, Mihir Prabhudesai, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Hao Liu, Deepak Pathak 출판일: 2025-08-05 카테고리: cs.LG, cs.AI DOI: None 링크: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03682 PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03682.pdf 초록: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets. role: function content: 논문 상세 정보 Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control 저자: Zewen Yang, Dongfa Zhang, Xiaobing Dai, Fengyi Yu, Chi Zhang, Bingkun Huang, Hamid Sadeghian, Sami Haddadin 출판일: 2025-08-05 카테고리: cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, stat.ML DOI: None 링크: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03679 PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03679.pdf 초록: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a \\underline{s}treaming \\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\\underline{y} generated expert framework of \\underline{G}aussian \\underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. role: function content: 논문 상세 정보 A DbC Inspired Neurosymbolic Layer for Trustworthy Agent Design 저자: Claudiu Leoveanu-Condrei 출판일: 2025-08-05 카테고리: cs.LG, cs.AI, I.2.7; I.2.2; I.1.2; D.1.0 DOI: None 링크: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03665 PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03665.pdf 초록: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \\emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts. role: assistant content: Complete Analysis Summary Based on my analysis, here's what I've found for you: Current Machine Learning Trends (Past 30 Days) The hottest topics in arXiv's Machine Learning (cs.LG) category include: Large Language Models (LLMs) - Continued focus on capabilities and limitations Reinforcement Learning - Especially human preference alignment Self-supervised Learning - Models improving without external data Multimodal AI - Integration across different data types Generative AI - Trustworthiness and reliability concerns Top 5 Most Recent Papers with Full Details PAC Apprenticeship Learning with Bayesian Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning Authors: Ondrej Bajgar, Dewi S.W.

This review aims to explore the interaction between IF and circadian rhythms, focusing on their combined effects on cardiometabolic risks and cardiovascular outcomes. Evidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that IF provides protective effects against cardiac damage and dysfunction. It is also indicated that IF influences key cardiometabolic risk factors, such as insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, by aligning with the intrinsic biological rhythms.

In this perspective, we discuss evidence that may support potential adverse effects of intermittent fasting on cardiovascular health through the loss of lean mass, circadian misalignment and poor dietary choices associated with reward-based eating. Given the ongoing revolution in obesity pharmacotherapy, we argue that future research should integrate anti-obesity medications with dietary strategies that confer robust benefits to cardiometabolic health, combine exercise regimens, and consider genetic factors to personalize obesity treatment.

High total energy intake coupled with unhealthy consumption of ultra-processed foods and saturated fats have long been regarded as major dietary drivers of NAFLD. However, there is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that the timing of energy intake across a the day is also an important determinant of individual risk for NAFLD and associated metabolic conditions. This review summarises the available observational and epidemiological data describing associations between eating patterns and metabolic disease, including the negative effects of irregular meal patterns, skipping breakfast and night-time eating on liver health. We suggest that that these harmful behaviours deserve greater consideration in the risk stratification and management of patients with NAFLD particularly in a 24-hour society with continuous availability of food and with up to 20% of the population now engaged in shiftwork with mistimed eating patterns. We also draw on studies reporting the liver-specific impact of Ramadan, which represents a unique real-world opportunity to explore the physiological impact of fasting. By highlighting data from preclinical and pilot human studies, we present a further biological rationale for manipulating timing of energy intake to improve metabolic health and discuss how this may be mediated through restoration of natural circadian rhythms. Lastly, we comprehensively review the landscape of human trials of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating in metabolic disease and offer a look to the future about how these dietary strategies may benefit patients with NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis." } { "PMID": "35583495", "Title": "Worsening Glycemia Increases the Odds of Intermittent but Not Persistent Staphylococcus aureus Nasal Carriage in Two Cohorts of Mexican American Adults.", "Authors": "Essigmann, Hanis, DeSantis, Perkison, Aguilar, Jun, Robinson, Brown", "Journal": "Microbiology spectrum", "Publication Date": "2022", "Abstract": "Numerous host and environmental factors contribute to persistent and intermittent nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage in humans.

It is also commonplace among different species, from humans, to animals, to lower eukaryotes. Research on fasting is gaining traction based on recent studies that show its role in many adaptive cellular responses such as the reduction of oxidative damage and inflammation, increase of energy metabolism, and in boosting cellular protection. In this expert review, we recount the historical evolution of fasting and we critically analyze its current medical applications, including benefits and caveats. Based on the available data, we conclude that the manipulation of dietary intake, in the form of calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, dietary restriction with the exclusion of some nutrients, prolonged fasting, and so forth, is anthropologically engraved in human culture possibly because of its positive health effects. Indeed, many studies show that fasting ameliorates many biochemical parameters related to cardiovascular and cancer risk, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistic studies are plentiful, but largely limited to cell cultures or laboratory animals. Understandably, there are no controlled trials of any form of fasting that gauge the effects on [any cause] mortality. Physicians should be aware that misinformation is pervasive and that their patients often adopt dietary regimens that are far from being clinically validated. Moreover, doctors are often unaware of their patients\' religious or traditional fasting and of its potential health effects. Based on current evidence, no long-term fasting should be undertaken without medical supervision until future research will hopefully help shed further light on fasting and its effects on human health." } { "PMID": "34919135", "Title": "Intermittent Fasting and Obesity-Related Health Outcomes: An Umbrella Review of Meta-analyses of Randomized Clinical Trials.", "Authors": "Patikorn, Roubal, Veettil, Chandran, Pham, Lee, Giovannucci, Varady, Chaiyakunapruk", "Journal": "JAMA network open", "Publication Date": "2021", "Abstract": "Several meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the many health benefits of intermittent fasting (IF).

While various dietary patterns have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear. This network meta-analysis (NMA) systematically evaluates the impact of eight dietary patterns on cardiovascular risk markers. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing low-fat, Mediterranean, ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, vegetarian, intermittent fasting, and DASH diets. A random-effects model analyzed mean differences (MD) in body composition (weight, BMI, waist circumference), lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C), glycemic markers (glucose), and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic). Dietary efficacy was ranked via Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) scores. Among 21 RCTs (1,663 participants), ketogenic (MD -10.5 kg, 95% CI -18.0 to -3.05; SUCRA 99) and high-protein diets (MD -4.49 kg, 95% CI -9.55 to 0.35; SUCRA 71) showed superior efficacy for weight reduction. For waist circumference, ketogenic (MD -11.0 cm, 95% CI -17.5 to -4.54; SUCRA 100) and low-carbohydrate diets (MD -5.13 cm, 95% CI -8.83 to -1.44; SUCRA 77) achieved greatest reductions. DASH diet most effectively lowered systolic blood pressure (MD -7.81 mmHg, 95% CI -14.2 to -0.46; SUCRA 89), while intermittent fasting also demonstrated significant blood pressure-lowering effects (MD -5.98 mmHg, 95% CI -10.4 to -0.35; SUCRA 76). Low-carbohydrate (MD 4.26 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.46-6.49; SUCRA 98) and low-fat diets (MD 2.35 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.21-4.40; SUCRA 78) optimally increased HDL-C. Diet-specific cardioprotective effects were observed: ketogenic and high-protein diets excel in weight management, DASH and intermittent fasting in blood pressure control, and carbohydrate-restricted diets in lipid modulation.

This review aims to explore the interaction between IF and circadian rhythms, focusing on their combined effects on cardiometabolic risks and cardiovascular outcomes. Evidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that IF provides protective effects against cardiac damage and dysfunction. It is also indicated that IF influences key cardiometabolic risk factors, such as insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism, by aligning with the intrinsic biological rhythms. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of IF in cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in individuals with circadian disruptions.

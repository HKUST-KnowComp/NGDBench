How can I accomplish this? role: assistant content: I'll help you create an automated test script by recording your manual interactions with your company's login page.

I can see several good text models available. For creative descriptive writing, I'll use OpenAI GPT-4.1 as it has the largest context window (5000 characters) and is specifically designed for text generation. Now let me generate a vivid description of a cyberpunk marketplace at twilight: role: function content: Error generating text response: Failed to generate text: Payment Required role: assistant content: Let me try using the standard OpenAI model instead: role: function content: As twilight drapes itself over the sprawling cyberpunk marketplace, the last vestiges of natural sunlight bleed into a spectrum of dusky oranges and muted purple, flickering against the jagged silhouettes of towering holo-ads and rusted scaffolding. Above, the neon signs ignite in furious bursts—pulsing pinks, electric blues, and sickly greens—casting flickering, discordant glows that dance across wet, uneven cobblestones slick with a mixed cocktail of rain and oil. The air hums with a complex symphony: the distant crackle of static, the eerie whine of machinery winding down, and the murmurs of vendors hawking their wares amidst the clamorous chaos. The smells assault the senses—hot spices infused with burnt circuitry, the sharp tang of recycled air blended with the scent of ozone. Stall after stall displays a grotesque kaleidoscope of technological wonders: neuro-implants gleaming like fractured gemstones, plasma rifles crackling softly, bio-mods shimmering with iridescent fluids, and glowing data chips piled like digital gemstones. Vendors—clad in patchwork of synthetic leathers, metallic accents, and tattered tech-fabrics—range from grizzled cyborgs sporting half-cybernetic faces to sleek, drone-augmented humans with flickering ocular implants. They call out in a chorus of guttural voices and high-pitched keening, bargaining over prices as their eyes dart nervously toward the shadows flickering at the edges of the marketplace. Customers are a mosaic of the augmented and unaltered: neon-lit street racers with holo-visors reflecting their own flashing reflections, corporate mercenaries in tactical gear, and desperate locals clutching bundles of cash or circuit-laden relics. Tattoos glow faintly beneath translucent skin, while augmented limbs click and whir with each movement. Some hurried by, cloaked in damp, oversized coats—walking in the liminal space between day’s end and night’s beginning, reluctant to expose their true selves beneath the looming neon glow. This moment—neither fully day nor night—feels charged with anticipation and a touch of menace. The marketplace pulses like a living, breathing creature, alive with the hum of technology and the restless pulse of the city’s underbelly. It’s a liminal haven where the future’s promise mixes with decay, a place that exists just at the edge of the known world, flickering in the radiant glow of dying daylight and the electric embrace of neon darkness. role: assistant content: Perfect! Now I have this rich, atmospheric description.
